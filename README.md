# Remove Background
Remove background from a Blender VSE Movie or Image strip

Breaks bc of this error: https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/issues/312

# Installation
Blender must be run "as administrator" in order to install the python lib [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) properly.

[Download](https://github.com/tin2tin/remove_background/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and install the add-on as you normally would.

If you don not have a CUDA supported GPU, change the script to install and use the rembg lib without [GPU] instead.

# Usage
Select a Movie or Image strip and run the operator from the Strip menu.
