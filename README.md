# Remove Background
Remove background from a Blender VSE Movie or Image strip

# Installation
Blender must be run in order to install the python lib rembg properly.
Download and install the add-on as you normally would. 

If you don not have a CUDA supported GPU, change the sript to install and use the rembg without [GPU] instead.

# Usage
Select a Movie or Image strip and run the operator from the Strip menu.
